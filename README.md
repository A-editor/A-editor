## ðŸ‘· Work
Currently looking for a fullstack or frontend developer role. I am most experienced with JavaScript using React and Node.js, as well as Postgres, though I have also worked using MongoDb and MySQL. I studied web development and computer science at Hack Reactor ('20) and I studied English at Emory University ('08).

## ðŸ”¬ Projects
[Hyper-fashion](https://github.com/A-editor/Hyper-Fashion) is an interactive front-end shopping site built using React and Redux. It pulls from an existing API to generate a single page application, which can be navigated using React Router/Hash Routes.

[Tabs-Manager](https://github.com/A-editor/Tabs-Manager) Tabs Manager is a browser extension for Chrome, built using JS and React, meant to be most useful when a user has multiple tabs open from a few different websites. Tabs Manager will organize the tabs be website (alphabetically) and then categorize and display all tabs that are open in the extension window. You are also able to navigate to each tab from the extension window by clicking a button next to the tab information.

[QnABackend](https://github.com/A-editor/QnAbackend) is an API for interfacing with Hyper-fashion's front-end Questions and Answers display, using Postgres as its database and various scaling tools to handle high user loads (pgpool, NGINX, etc.).
